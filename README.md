# OrcaSlicer Profile Comparer

Compare OrcaSlicer filament and process profiles side by side, see exactly which settings differ, and (soon) copy settings between profiles. Runs as a desktop app on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and later as an OrcaSlicer plugin.

**Status:** early development. Comparing works (read-only); copying and saving don't yet.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or later, and pnpm 12 (`npm install -g pnpm@12`)
- Python 3.12 or later, for the plugin's Python tests
- For the desktop app: Rust and [Tauri's system prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:playground   # the UI in a browser, using sample profiles
pnpm dev:desktop      # the Tauri desktop app, reading your OrcaSlicer profiles
pnpm test             # TypeScript tests
pnpm test:python      # plugin Python tests
pnpm lint             # ESLint + dependency rules
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build:desktop
pnpm build:plugin     # writes apps/orca-plugin/dist/orca_profile_comparer.py
```

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first. It covers the architecture, the package dependency rules, and the OrcaSlicer details the code relies on. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) has a diagram of how the pieces fit.
