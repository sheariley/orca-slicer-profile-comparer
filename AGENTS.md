# AGENTS.md

OrcaSlicer Profile Comparer: a cross-platform tool for comparing OrcaSlicer **filament** and **process** profiles in a diff-like view of how their settings differ. It's also an editor. From the diff view, users can copy individual setting values from one profile to another, or bulk-copy settings from one profile to many target profiles at once, and save the changed profiles back to disk. It ships first as a Tauri desktop app and later as an OrcaSlicer plugin, running the same UI and core in both.

**Status:** comparing works end to end (read-only) in the playground, desktop, and plugin builds. The desktop app builds and runs on Windows and in WSL, and has been checked against a real OrcaSlicer data folder on Windows. Editing and saving aren't built yet.

**Open work is tracked in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).** Check it before starting, and keep it current: add tasks you discover, and mark the ones you finish `[x]`, in the same change.

**OrcaSlicer source:** many directives here point into OrcaSlicer's source code, which is the source of truth for the profile format, setting definitions, and plugin API. In the local workspace a clone sits next to this repo at `../OrcaSlicer/`. Otherwise, clone [OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer). Treat it as read-only reference material.

## Requirements

- **User-friendly UI.** The audience is OrcaSlicer users, not developers, so the UI should feel like a polished desktop tool, on mouse and touch displays alike. The rules are in "UI/UX rules" below.
- **Cross-platform.** It must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, matching OrcaSlicer's own platforms:
  - Use a stack and packaging that ship on all three.
  - Build file paths with platform APIs, never hard-coded separators.
  - Detect the OrcaSlicer config directory per OS (see "OrcaSlicer profile format") and let users override it.
  - Handle preset filenames that contain spaces, `@`, and other unusual characters. Don't assume the filesystem is case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
  - Expect Windows file locking when OrcaSlicer has a file open.
  - Run tests and CI on all three OSes.

## UI/UX rules

These apply to every host (desktop, plugin, playground). When a rule here conflicts with convenience in code, the rule wins.

### Input and accessibility

- **Every hover interaction needs a touch-friendly alternative.** Touch displays have no hover, so nothing may be reachable only by hovering:
  - Wherever a hover tooltip is used or applicable, also show an "info" icon next to the element. Clicking or tapping the icon shows the same tooltip content.
  - The icon is a real button with an accessible name (e.g. "About Nozzle temperature"). It works from the keyboard (Enter/Space opens, Escape closes), and the tooltip closes on a second tap or a tap outside.
  - Put the tooltip text in one place and use it for both the hover and the icon, so the two never drift apart.
  - Native `title` attributes alone don't satisfy this rule; they're hover-only and unreachable by touch or keyboard.
  - **Use `InfoTip`** (`packages/ui/src/components/InfoTip.tsx`) for every tooltip; it implements all of the above. Don't add `title` attributes.
  - In dense tables, give each row one info tip that covers the whole row (e.g. the setting's description plus where each side's value came from) rather than an icon per cell.
- **Size touch targets for fingers.** Buttons, checkboxes, info icons, and picker rows need a hit area of at least 32 × 32 CSS px (44 × 44 preferred), even when the visible glyph is smaller.
- **Label every control.** Use a visible `<label>` or an `aria-label`, and semantic roles (`tablist`/`tab`, `table`, `alert`). Component tests query by role and label (React Testing Library), which keeps this honest.
- **Support the keyboard.** Every action reachable by mouse or touch must also be reachable by keyboard, with a visible focus indicator.

### Comparing

- **Side-by-side diff.** Two value columns of equal width next to a setting column, with a sticky header naming both presets. Long values wrap instead of overflowing.
- **Show only differences by default,** with a toggle that shows everything. The toggle shows the count of differences.
- **Filter by setting name,** matching both OrcaSlicer's label and the raw key.
- **Label settings the way OrcaSlicer does.** Show OrcaSlicer's label (preferring its full label over the short tab label), and the raw key underneath in a muted monospace style. Show the key only when it differs from the label. Group settings the way OrcaSlicer's tabs do (not built yet).
- **Render values readably.** Join arrays with commas, show multi-line G-code as multi-line text, and show the unit after a value. Never add a unit to a value that's already a percentage, and drop the "or %" part of units like "mm/s² or %" for plain numbers.
- **Show where every value came from.** Its tooltip (hover, plus the info icon) names the preset that set it. Built-in OrcaSlicer defaults are visually distinct (muted, italic) and say so.
- **Never silently drop data from the view.** Keys OrcaSlicer ignores (not in the setting catalog) are hidden by default behind a "Hide settings OrcaSlicer doesn't use (N)" toggle that shows the count, never removed outright.
- **Highlight changed rows** with the `--c-changed` token, including rows set on only one side.

### Picking presets

- **Browse, don't type.** Pick presets from lists of system and user presets, filterable by vendor and printer, or open a file. Never ask for a path.
- **Make every option identifiable.** Show the origin (vendor or "User") with each name. When the same name appears more than once (e.g. in two user folders), add whatever tells them apart.
- **Hide non-selectable templates** (`instantiation: "false"`) by default.

### Editing and bulk copy

- **One-click transfer** of a value in either direction.
- **Always show unsaved changes,** offer undo, and confirm before saving.
- **Ask about redundant overrides with an "Pin override" checkbox** on each affected setting, in the preview of a copy (see "Writing profiles back"). Its tooltip (an `InfoTip`) explains the trade-off: keeping the override pins the value, so changes to the parent no longer reach it; unchecking re-links it to the parent.
- **Bulk copy:** pick one or more settings in a source profile and copy them to many targets of the same type in one action.
  - Choose targets from the preset browser, with multi-select, filters (vendor, printer, user vs. system), and select-all.
  - Before applying, preview each target: the current value, the new value, and which targets already match and will be skipped.
  - Apply the batch as one undoable step, while letting users drop individual targets or settings from it.
  - When the batch includes system presets, ask once whether to create user presets for them, and list which ones that affects.

### Saving and feedback

- **Report results per target:** saved, skipped, failed, or needs a new user preset. One failure must not stop the others or hide which ones succeeded, and failed edits stay pending so the user can retry.
- **Tell users what to do next.** If OrcaSlicer must re-select a preset or restart to see a change, the save result says so and the UI tells the user. Never assume the change took effect.
- **Warn about a running OrcaSlicer,** which may overwrite saved files or not pick up changes.

### Errors and host limits

- **Explain errors in plain language.** Show a short explanation of the error's kind, plus the specific detail (which preset, which parent, which file). Never show raw exceptions or stack traces. Errors must not crash the UI.
- **Adapt to host capabilities, and say so.** When a host can't do something (e.g. `canSave: false`), show it (the "Read-only" badge) and disable or hide the action with an explanation, instead of letting it fail.

### Visual design and theming

- **Take colors only from design tokens** (CSS variables in `packages/ui/src/theme/`). Component styles (`base.css`) never hard-code colors.
  - `desktop.css` defines the token values for the desktop app and the playground, with light and dark variants that follow the OS (`prefers-color-scheme`).
  - `orca.css` maps the tokens onto the variables OrcaSlicer injects into plugin pages (`--orca-bg`, `--orca-fg`, `--orca-muted`, `--orca-border`, `--orca-accent`, `--orca-accent-fg`, `--orca-font`), so the plugin follows OrcaSlicer's theme.
- **Look at home in OrcaSlicer:** compact density (13 px base font), OrcaSlicer's accent color for selection and primary actions, and its font inside the plugin.
- **Use only features every target web view supports:** WebView2 (Windows), WebKit (macOS), and WebKitGTK (Linux).
- **Keep the plugin page self-contained:** no external fonts, images, or scripts. Everything is inlined into one HTML file.

## Stack

- **Use TypeScript everywhere outside the Python plugin layer.** Use React for the UI and Vite for builds. Don't use Next.js: there's no server.
- **Ship the desktop app with Tauri 2.** Use Tauri's official JS plugins (file system, path, dialog) for host access, and keep custom Rust to the minimum. Tauri is chosen over Electron because it renders in the OS web view, the same engines the OrcaSlicer plugin runs in (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux). Web view quirks then show up during desktop development.
- **Plan for an OrcaSlicer plugin as a second host.** The same UI and core must later run as an OrcaSlicer plugin without changes. See "OrcaSlicer plugin target".
- **Use pnpm workspaces for the monorepo.** Its strict installs back up the layering: a package can only import what it declares. Don't switch to npm, Yarn, or Bun without revisiting [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-pnpm-workspaces.md), which records the reasons and alternatives.
- **Use Vitest** for unit and contract tests, and **React Testing Library** for component tests.
- **Keep TypeScript on 6.0** until typescript-eslint supports TypeScript 7 (its peer range is `<6.1`). The pin and its reason are in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Run tools with Node's built-in TypeScript support** (`node file.ts`, Node 22.18+). Tools and build scripts need no compile step.
- **Record significant decisions as ADRs** in `docs/adr/`.

## Architecture: isolate the UI and core from hosts

The host interface (Tauri) and the plugin interface (OrcaSlicer's Python `orca` API, still new) will both change. Design so a change in either touches only that host's adapter.

- **Split the code into layers with one-way dependencies:** `ui` → `app` → `core`. Host adapters depend on `core` (to implement its ports). Nothing in `core`, `app`, or `ui` depends on an adapter.
  - **`core`:** pure domain logic. Covers the profile model, value normalization, inheritance resolution with provenance, diffing, the edit model for transfers (one source to one or many targets), undo/redo, and serialization that preserves formatting. No I/O, DOM, React, Tauri, or `orca` imports. Everything is deterministic and synchronous where possible.
  - **`app`:** use cases such as "load profiles to compare", "transfer value", "bulk transfer to many targets", "save changes", and "list available presets". These coordinate `core` with the ports. The UI calls only this layer.
  - **`ui`:** React components and hooks. They get the `app` layer through context. The UI never calls a host API directly.
- **`core` owns the ports.** Define host-facing interfaces in `core/ports` in domain terms: for example a `ProfileRepository` (list presets, read a raw profile document, save one), a `SettingCatalog` (labels, units, groups), and a `SettingsStore` (user preferences). Adapters implement them. Never shape a port after one host's API.
- **Let hosts declare their capabilities.** Each adapter reports what it supports (for example `canSave`, `canBrowseFiles`, `canWatchForChanges`). The `app` and `ui` layers adapt to those capabilities, such as making the view read-only when saving isn't supported, instead of checking which host they're in. Never branch on "am I in Tauri or OrcaSlicer?" outside the composition root.
- **Translate at the boundary.** Adapters convert host data (Tauri paths, `orca` `Preset` objects, JSON messages) into core types and back. Host types must never leak past an adapter.
- **Validate everything crossing a boundary.** Parse plugin messages and profile files with schemas (zod) before they reach `core`. Treat host data as untrusted.
- **Have the core resolve inheritance itself, from raw profile documents.** Some hosts hand over already-resolved values (the OrcaSlicer plugin API does), but only the raw document says which keys a profile owns, and saving depends on that. Treat host-resolved values as a cross-check at most.
- **Use one composition root per app.** Each entry point (desktop, plugin, playground) is the only place that picks and wires an adapter.
- **Treat a single transfer as a bulk transfer with one target.** Use one code path in `core` and `app` for both, so the same rules apply either way: skip targets that are already equal, check type and key compatibility, decide array lengths, and handle system targets. A batch is one undo step made of per-target change sets, and `saveChanges` returns a result for each target instead of all-or-nothing.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Before building a shared UI component or a general-purpose utility (tooltips, popovers, dialogs, menus, virtualized lists, date handling, ...), look for a vetted, mature package: actively maintained, widely used, accessible, typed, and compatible with our targets (React 19, all three OS web views, a single-file plugin build).
  - **Add the dependency only when its behavior clearly matches what we need.** It's fine if the package does more than we need.
  - **Prefer our own implementation when the package would need patching,** monkey-patching, or fighting its intended behavior (e.g. a tooltip library that deliberately refuses to open on click, when we need click). Forcing a package against its design costs more than writing the thing ourselves.
  - **Record the choice:** the package, why it fits, and the alternatives rejected and why. Use an ADR for significant choices, or a comment in the component that wraps the package.
  - **Wrap third-party UI behind our own component** (e.g. `InfoTip` over Floating UI), so the rest of the UI doesn't depend on the package directly and replacing it touches one file.
- **Enforce the layering with tooling, not convention.** Make each layer a workspace package and add ESLint (`no-restricted-imports`) and dependency-cruiser rules that fail the build on forbidden imports. See "Dependency rules".

### Dependency rules

Enforce these with ESLint and dependency-cruiser so CI fails on a violation. Don't rely on code review to catch them.

| Package                     | May depend on                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core`                      | nothing in the workspace; no React, Tauri, DOM, or Node APIs |
| `app`                       | `core`                                                       |
| `ui`                        | `app`, `core` (types only)                                   |
| `setting-catalog`           | `core`                                                       |
| `bridge-protocol`           | nothing in the workspace except `core` types                 |
| `host-contract-tests`       | `core`                                                       |
| `host-memory`, `host-tauri` | `core`                                                       |
| `host-orca`                 | `core`, `bridge-protocol`                                    |
| `apps/*`                    | anything; these are the composition roots                    |
| `tools/*`                   | anything; never imported by packages or apps                 |

- **Only composition roots in `apps/*` import a host adapter.** `ui` and `app` never import a `host-*` package, `@tauri-apps/*`, or anything plugin-specific.
- **Import other packages only through their `index.ts`.** Never import a path deeper inside another package. The one exception is `@comparer/ui/theme/*.css`, which the composition roots import to pick a theme.
- **Tests may also use `host-memory` and `host-contract-tests`**, declared as devDependencies. That's how `app` and `ui` are tested without a real host.
- **Declare every import in `package.json`.** pnpm won't resolve undeclared packages, and dependency-cruiser's `not-to-unresolvable` rule reports them.
- **When you add a package,** add its rules to both `eslint.config.js` (a `restrict(...)` line) and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, and update the table above.

### Why it's structured this way

- **Each layer is a package** so the dependency rules can be checked mechanically, and pnpm's strict installs stop a package from importing anything it doesn't declare.
- **`bridge-protocol` is separate from `host-orca`.** The message format is the contract between TypeScript and Python. Both sides test against its sample messages, because the Python layer is stdlib-only and can't share the zod schemas.
- **`host-contract-tests` keeps adapters interchangeable.** Every adapter must pass the same suite. That's what makes testing `app` and `ui` against `host-memory` trustworthy.
- **`setting-catalog` is generated data behind the `SettingCatalog` port.** Both hosts use the same data. Tests can substitute a small fake.
- **`playground` is where most UI work happens.** Run the Tauri app only when real file-system behavior matters.

## Conventions

- **Package names:** `@comparer/<name>`, all `private: true`.
- **Workspace dependencies:** use `workspace:*` for packages in this repo, and `catalog:` for shared third-party versions (React, TypeScript, Vite, zod, Vitest) defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Tests:** put `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` next to the code they test. Shared fixtures go in the owning package's `test/fixtures/`.
- **Generated files:** never edit them by hand. Regenerate `packages/setting-catalog/data/settings.json` with `pnpm extract-settings`, the system-profile fixtures with `pnpm sync-fixtures`, and the plugin with `pnpm build:plugin`.
- **Source imports use explicit `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions** (`allowImportingTsExtensions`). Packages export their TypeScript source directly; there's no per-package build step.
- **Formatting:** Prettier (`pnpm format`). CI runs `pnpm format:check`.

## Testing

- **Unit-test `core` thoroughly** with fixtures copied from real OrcaSlicer profiles (OrcaSlicer's `resources/profiles/`), including multi-level inheritance, array values, percentages, and G-code.
- **Run the shared contract suite (`host-contract-tests`) against every adapter** (memory, Tauri, plugin) so they behave the same.
- **Test the `app` and `ui` layers against `host-memory`.** They should never need a real file system or OrcaSlicer to be tested.
- **Make sure `ui` runs in a plain browser with `host-memory`** (the `playground` app) for fast development and previews.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:playground     # UI in a browser against host-memory + core's fixtures
pnpm dev:desktop        # Tauri dev build (needs Rust)
pnpm test               # Vitest across all packages
pnpm test:python        # plugin Python tests (unittest)
pnpm lint               # ESLint + dependency-cruiser
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit in every package
pnpm format             # Prettier
pnpm build:desktop      # Tauri release build
pnpm build:plugin       # single-file plugin: apps/orca-plugin/dist/orca_profile_comparer.py
pnpm extract-settings   # regenerate the setting catalog from ../OrcaSlicer (or --orca <path>; --verbose lists skipped defaults)
pnpm sync-fixtures      # refresh system-profile fixtures from ../OrcaSlicer (or --orca <path>)
```

Before finishing a change, run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test`, plus `pnpm test:python` if you touched the plugin or the bridge protocol. Update `TASKS.md` too.

## Development environment

- **pnpm 12:** install it with `npm install -g pnpm@12`. Corepack 0.34 can't run pnpm 12 (it looks for a `pnpm.cjs` that pnpm 12 no longer ships).
- **WSL with the repo on a Windows drive (`/mnt/...`) is too slow for tests.** Each file lookup takes milliseconds, so jsdom takes over a minute to load and Vitest's "dom" project times out starting its worker. Either run commands from Windows itself (PowerShell with Windows Node), or work from a clone on the Linux filesystem (e.g. `~/src/...`). Don't treat that timeout as a code bug.
- **Desktop builds need Rust** and [Tauri's system prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). Everything else only needs Node and Python. A first build takes about 3 minutes; later builds take seconds.
- **On Windows, `pnpm` may be Corepack's shim** (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\pnpm.ps1`), which fails on pnpm 12 the same way. Run `corepack disable pnpm`, then `npm install -g pnpm@12`, or use `npx pnpm@12.9.1`. In PowerShell scripts, call `npx.cmd`, not `npx`: the `npx.ps1` shim drops arguments passed with `@args`.
- **Don't share one checkout's `node_modules` between WSL and Windows.** pnpm installs only the current platform's native binaries (Vite's bundler, the Tauri CLI), so installing from one side breaks the other. Use one side per checkout.
- **To drive the desktop app from a script,** enable WebView2's DevTools port in a local, uncommitted copy of `tauri.conf.json`: set `app.windows[0].additionalBrowserArgs` to `"--disable-features=msWebOOUI,msPdfOOUI,msSmartScreenProtection --remote-debugging-port=9333"`. The `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` environment variable is ignored, because Tauri passes its own browser arguments. Then connect to `http://127.0.0.1:9333/json` with the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

## Host adapters as built

- **Desktop (`host-tauri`):**
  - Reads OrcaSlicer's data folder (`configDir()/OrcaSlicer`):
    - `system/<Vendor>/<type>/*.json` for system presets. Only the vendors the user installed are there.
    - `user/<user_id>/<type>/*.json` for user presets.
    - `user/<user_id>/<type>/base/*.json` for user root presets (`inherits: ""`, every setting spelled out).
    - `<user_id>` is `default` when signed out, or the account id when signed in. Both folders can exist, often with copies of the same presets.
  - Preset ids are absolute file paths. Names come from file names, which OrcaSlicer keeps equal to preset names.
  - Parents resolve in the child's own user folder first, then among system presets of the same vendor, then any system preset. Real user presets often inherit from other user presets, usually `base` ones.
  - A preset can name a parent that no longer exists. That's a real state of user data, so report it as `not-found`; it's not a bug.
  - Every file call goes through the `HostFileSystem` interface, so the contract tests run against an in-memory file system. The production implementation wraps Tauri's fs plugin.
  - File access is limited to `$CONFIG/OrcaSlicer` by `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`. Widen that scope deliberately, never with a blanket permission.
  - Saving reports `canSave: false` until desktop saving lands (slice E4 in `TASKS.md`).
- **Plugin (`host-orca` + `apps/orca-plugin/python/`):**
  - Preset ids are `"<type>:<name>"`, unique within a preset collection. A system preset's vendor is the folder two levels above its file.
  - The plugin builds to a single `.py` file with a PEP 723 header, the bridge code, and the page inlined.
  - `get_icon()` isn't implemented yet. It needs a path to an icon file, which a single-file plugin doesn't ship.
  - The plugin has only been exercised against a stand-in `orca` module, not inside OrcaSlicer. Test it in an OrcaSlicer nightly before relying on it.

## OrcaSlicer profile format

- Profiles are JSON objects that mix settings with **metadata keys**. The metadata keys are listed in `METADATA_KEYS` (`core/src/model/profile.ts`). They come from the `BBL_JSON_KEY_*` / `ORCA_JSON_KEY_*` constants in OrcaSlicer's `Preset.hpp`, plus the `*_settings_id` options that only repeat the preset's name: `type` (`filament` / `process` / `machine`), `name`, `inherits`, `include`, `from` (`system` / `User`), `setting_id`, `base_id`, `user_id`, `filament_id`, `instantiation`, `version`, `is_custom_defined`, `description`, `renamed_from`, `created_time`, `updated_time`, `filament_settings_id`, `print_settings_id`, and `printer_settings_id`. Metadata is never inherited, compared, or copied. `compatible_printers` is a real setting, not metadata.
- **Inheritance:** a profile usually lists only the keys it overrides and points to a parent through `inherits` (by preset name, e.g. `"Bambu ABS @base"` or `"fdm_process_single_0.06_nozzle_0.2"`). Parents can chain several levels deep. A meaningful comparison needs the **fully resolved** profile: walk the `inherits` chain and let child keys override parent keys. The UI shows where each value came from (hover), and marks built-in defaults.
- **Built-in defaults (implemented):** a root preset (no `inherits`) starts from OrcaSlicer's built-in default of every setting its type owns, and `resolveChain` does the same:
  - The defaults come from `set_default_value` in `PrintConfig.cpp`, serialized exactly as OrcaSlicer writes them to profiles (`%g`-style numbers, `"1"`/`"0"` booleans, enum keys, `"0x0"` points).
  - Which settings a type owns comes from `s_Preset_print_options` (process) and `s_Preset_filament_options` (filament) in `Preset.cpp`.
  - The setting catalog serves both through `SettingCatalog.defaultsFor(type)`.
  - Filament overrides of printer settings (`filament_retraction_length`, ...) are defined in a loop that copies the printer setting's label and default; the extractor follows it.
- **Legacy keys (partly implemented):** OrcaSlicer's `PrintConfigDef::handle_legacy` runs on every key it loads. It discards obsolete keys (the `ignore` set, e.g. `adaptive_layer_height`) and renames old ones (`enable_wipe_tower` → `enable_prime_tower`). `resolveChain` applies both from `SettingCatalog.legacyKeys()`; when a file has an old key and its replacement, the replacement wins. Rules that rewrite values aren't applied.
- **Unknown keys:** OrcaSlicer ignores keys it doesn't define, and Bambu's bundled profiles carry dozens of them (Bambu Studio leftovers such as `counter_coef_1`). The diff view hides keys the catalog doesn't know behind a "Hide settings OrcaSlicer doesn't use" toggle (on by default). The catalog must therefore cover every real setting; see `tools/extract-settings` for the definition forms it understands.
- **`include` templates (not implemented yet):** about 1,500 bundled profiles also list `include`, an array of template preset names (or one bare name). OrcaSlicer resolves a preset as follows (`PresetBundle.cpp`, the install step after `parse_subfile`):
  1. Start from the parent's resolved settings. A preset with no `inherits` starts from OrcaSlicer's built-in defaults instead (`set_default_value` in `PrintConfig.cpp`).
  2. Layer each included template on top, in the order listed. What gets layered is the template's resolved settings minus the defaults, not just the keys in its own file.
  3. Apply the preset's own keys last.

  OrcaSlicer then pads per-variant arrays to the parent's length. Extend `resolveChain` to support this before comparing profiles that use `include`. The current fixtures don't.

- `instantiation: "true"` marks a preset users can pick. `"false"` (or a missing key on `@base` / `fdm_*` templates) marks an abstract parent.
- **Values are strings.** Numbers and booleans are stored as strings (`"0.4"`, `"1"`). Per-extruder or per-filament settings are arrays of strings (e.g. `"hot_plate_temp": ["100"]`). Some values are percentages (`"50%"`) or multi-line G-code. Normalize before comparing so that, say, `"16"` and `["16"]` don't show up as a false difference.
- Parent names are resolved within the same vendor directory. Filaments and processes also inherit from shared bases such as `fdm_filament_common` and `fdm_process_common`, found in the vendor folder or in `resources/profiles/OrcaFilamentLibrary/`.
- User-created presets live in the OrcaSlicer config directory under `user/<user_id>/{filament,process,machine}/` (`%APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer` on Windows, `~/.config/OrcaSlicer` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer` on macOS). Each is a `.json` with a sibling `.info` file. They often inherit from a system preset by name.
- Human-readable labels, units, and categories for each key come from `PrintConfig.cpp`. Commented-out definitions there are retired options; the extractor strips comments before parsing so they don't become settings.

## Writing profiles back (transfer and save)

`core/edit/` implements the transfer rules below (`planTransfer`), and the edit history (batches, undo/redo, and `pendingEdits`, the net edits per target that saving writes through `core/serialize/`). The app layer builds each target's state: its own document, its resolved settings, and what it would inherit without its own overrides (its parent's resolved settings, or the built-in defaults for a root). When planning a new batch on top of pending edits, it must build that state from the edited documents.

- **Write to the profile's own file, not the resolved view.** Copying a value into a profile that inherits means adding or updating that key as an override in its own JSON. Don't flatten the whole inheritance chain into the file.
- **Let the user decide about redundant overrides ("Pin override").** When the target overrides a setting and the copied value equals what it would inherit, the override is redundant today, but it still pins the value: later changes to the parent won't reach it. Both choices are valid, so the user decides per setting:
  - Keeping the override ("Pin override" checked) writes the value as an override.
  - Dropping it (unchecked) removes the override, re-linking the setting to the parent.
  - The defaults change no more than the copy requires. An override that already holds the value stays (checked), so the file is untouched. One with a different value is dropped (unchecked), since the copy changes that setting anyway.
  - Where the target has no override of its own, there's no choice to make.
  - `planTransfer` lists these settings in each target plan's `redundantOverrides`, with the current choice. It takes the user's choices through `options.keepOverride`, and the UI re-plans when a checkbox changes.
- **System profiles are effectively read-only.** Files under `resources/profiles/` (and OrcaSlicer's installed or cached copies) get replaced on app updates. Saving should target user presets. If the target is a system preset, offer to save as a new user preset that `inherits` from it.
- **Keep OrcaSlicer's value format.** Write values back as strings or string arrays, in the shape the target already uses for that key (or the source's, if the target has none). A value with several elements is always written as an array, even if the target stored a plain string. Never write native JSON numbers or booleans.
- **Fit per-variant settings to the target's variants.** OrcaSlicer stores some settings once per extruder variant (e.g. `nozzle_temperature`, `filament_flow_ratio`, `fan_max_speed`). The catalog's `keyRules(type).perVariant` lists them, from `filament_options_with_variant` / `print_options_with_variant` in `PrintConfig.cpp`. A preset's variants are listed in `filament_extruder_variant` / `print_extruder_variant` (e.g. "Direct Drive Standard", "Direct Drive High Flow"); without that list, or with an empty one, a preset has one variant.
  - **A process variant is identified by its extruder and its name.** Processes also have `print_extruder_id`, which OrcaSlicer pairs with the names (`Preset::get_extruder_names_and_keysets`). On dual-extruder printers the names repeat once per extruder (Bambu's H2D: ids `1,1,1,2,2,2,2`, names Standard, High Flow, ... once per extruder), so a name alone is ambiguous. Filaments have no extruder ids (`filament_extruder_id` is commented out in OrcaSlicer), so a filament variant is identified by name. `variantIdentities()` in `core/edit/` implements this.

  When copying:
  - If both presets list their variants and the source has every one the target has, match values by identity, so a "High Flow" value never lands in a "Standard" slot and one extruder's values never land on the other.
  - Otherwise resize the way OrcaSlicer does when it loads a preset (`extend_default_config_length` → `ConfigOptionVector::resize`): truncate, or pad by repeating the **first** value. (OrcaSlicer's code comment says "last", but the code uses `front()`.)
  - Other arrays (G-code lists, `compatible_printers`, ...) are copied as they are.
  - Never copy the settings that define the variants (`VARIANT_KEYS`): the variant names, and for processes the extruder ids. They define the shape of every per-variant array.

- **Keep the metadata consistent.** Leave the target's metadata keys (`METADATA_KEYS`) alone. A transfer should never copy them across. For user presets, keep the sibling `.info` file valid. Check how OrcaSlicer writes it, including any update timestamp or sync fields, before touching it.
- **Avoid spurious diffs.** Save a file in the format it was read in, so it differs only in the keys that changed. `core/serialize/` does this: it detects each file's format and re-serializes in it.
  - **User presets** are written by OrcaSlicer's `ConfigBase::save_to_json` as canonical sorted-key JSON (nlohmann's sorted map), with a final newline and indentation that depends on the OrcaSlicer version that last saved the file.
  - **Line endings depend on the platform that saved the file:** CRLF on Windows, LF on macOS and Linux. OrcaSlicer only ever writes `\n`, and the file is opened in text mode (`write_whole_file` in `utils.cpp` uses `fopen(path, "w")`; before #15861, `boost::nowide::ofstream` without `std::ios::binary`). The C runtime turns `\n` into `\r\n` in text mode on Windows only. The serializer keeps each file's own line endings, so a file saved on one platform and edited on another stays as it was.
  - **New files** (nothing to detect from) use `orcaSlicerFormat(newline)`: tab indentation, sorted keys, a final newline, and the line endings of the platform the comparer runs on. `core` is platform-free, so the host supplies the newline. It's a required argument, so it can't be forgotten. Current versions use one tab per level (`dump(1, '\t')`); older ones used 4 spaces. A survey of 197 real user presets saved on Windows (versions 1.7–2.3) found exactly these two styles, all sorted, all CRLF. Built-in `JSON.stringify` with sorted keys reproduced every file byte for byte.
  - **Bundled profiles** use 4-space indentation and aren't necessarily sorted. The comparer never writes them (see above).
  - **String values** such as G-code contain real newlines, which JSON writes as `\n` escapes. Non-ASCII text (`℃`) is written as is, not `\u`-escaped. Vector options are arrays of each element's serialized form.
  - **Files that don't round-trip.** If a file doesn't re-serialize unchanged before any edit (e.g. someone edited it by hand), saving would reformat it. The serializer reports that, and the UI must warn before saving.
- **Make saves safe.** Write atomically (temp file, then rename), back up the file first (see below), and warn that OrcaSlicer may overwrite the file or not pick up the change while it's running. Users should close it, or re-select the preset, before or after saving.
- **Back up to a folder the app owns, never next to the original.** OrcaSlicer scans its preset folders, so stray files there (e.g. `My ABS.json.bak`) could show up as presets or confuse it.
  - Desktop: under Tauri's `appDataDir()` (e.g. `backups/<timestamp>/<path relative to the OrcaSlicer data folder>`), so every backup of one save sits together and is easy to restore.
  - The UI should tell users where backups are and offer to open the folder. Decide on pruning old backups when saving is built.
  - Plugin: back up the same way under the plugin's own storage, once plugin saving exists.
- **Only copy compatible keys.** Filament keys can only go into filament profiles and process keys into process profiles. The catalog's `keyRules(type).owned` lists them (from `Preset.cpp`). Keys OrcaSlicer doesn't define at all (Bambu Studio leftovers) are skipped as `not-owned` too.
- **Plan changes against the keys the file really holds.** A target may still store a setting under an old name that OrcaSlicer renames on load (e.g. `enable_wipe_tower`). `planTransfer` takes the legacy renames and writes the current key while removing the old one, or removes the old key when dropping a redundant override. Each `KeyChange.key` is a key as it appears in the file, so `pendingEdits` and the serializer need no legacy knowledge.
- **Explain every skipped key.** `planTransfer` returns a reason for each key it doesn't change: `metadata`, `variant-list`, `not-owned`, `missing-in-source`, or `already-equal`. The UI uses these in previews and results.
- **Apply every rule per target in a bulk copy.** Each target has its own inheritance chain, so the same copied value can be a new override in one target, redundant in another, and a different array length in a third. Resolve and validate each target on its own. Never assume what's true for one target holds for the rest.
- **Save bulk changes file by file, not all or nothing.** Each target is written atomically, but a batch can't be atomic across files. Save the targets one by one, collect a result for each, and keep failed targets' edits pending so the user can retry them. When the batch includes system presets, ask once whether to create user presets for them, and show which ones it affects.

## OrcaSlicer plugin target

What OrcaSlicer's plugin system offers today (in OrcaSlicer's `src/slic3r/plugin/`, with examples in `sandboxes/`):

- Plugins are Python 3.12 files with a `[tool.orcaslicer.plugin]` metadata header and an `@orca.plugin` class that registers capabilities.
- Plugin UI is HTML shown in OrcaSlicer's web view. There are two ways to show it:
  - **A Pages capability** (`PagesPluginCapability`) adds a **tab with an icon to OrcaSlicer's main window**. It implements `get_ui()` (returns the HTML), `get_icon()`, and `on_message(message)`, and sends to the page with `post_message(...)`. The tab appears while the plugin is enabled and disappears when it's unloaded.
  - **Windows and dock panels:** `orca.host.ui.create_window(html=...)` or `create_dock_panel(html=..., dock=...)`, opened from a script capability run from the Plugins dialog.
  - Either way, the page and Python exchange JSON through `orca.postMessage` / `orca.onMessage`, and theme colors come in as CSS variables (`--orca-fg`, `--orca-muted`, `--orca-border`, ...).
- **Plugin config storage** (PR #14746): each capability can store JSON settings with `get_config()` / `save_config(config)`. Settings are stored globally, with an optional override per preset. Users can edit them in the Plugins dialog through a JSON editor or a custom HTML page.
- `orca.host.preset_bundle()` gives read-only access to presets (`prints`, `filaments`, `printers`). Each preset has `name`, `file`, `is_system`, `is_user()`, `config_keys()`, and `config_value()` (resolved values). **There is no API to modify, save, or reload presets.**
- **Plugins are sandboxed on file access** (`PluginAuditManager`, from PR #14989). A CPython audit hook checks every file operation a plugin makes:
  - OrcaSlicer's data folder (`data_dir()`) is readable and writable. Its bundled resources folder is read-only. Any other path requires a permission the user grants.
  - Some files are always denied, even inside allowed folders: the app config (`OrcaSlicer.conf`/`.ini`), the user-secret file, and **any path where some component contains `secret`, `cert`, or `conf`** (case-insensitive).
  - The keyword match is a plain substring test on every folder and file name in the path. Issue [#15944](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/issues/15944) (open) reports that it blocks numpy, stdlib modules such as `configparser.py`, `certifi/cacert.pem`, and user folders like `Concert`. The only workaround is to import everything when the plugin loads, because only capability calls are checked.
  - **Probable Linux blocker (found by reading the code, not tested, and not yet reported upstream):** on Linux, `data_dir()` defaults to `~/.config/OrcaSlicer`, and `.config` contains `conf`. As written, every file access a plugin makes inside a checked call would be denied on Linux, presets included. A preset file whose name contains one of those keywords (e.g. "…Certified…") would also be denied on every OS.
  - The audit only covers calls into capabilities (`execute`, a Pages capability's `get_ui` and `on_message`, and so on). The `on_message` callbacks passed to `create_window`/`create_dock_panel` currently run without an audit scope. Treat that as a gap that will probably be closed, not as a feature.
- **Status** (from [discussion #14878](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/discussions/14878), the maintainers' feedback thread):
  - Plugins are nightly-only and "experimental and subject to change". The APIs and capability types "may change significantly".
  - There's no release date and no versioning promise.
  - Maintainers have nothing against plugins that read and write, but they haven't committed to a preset write API.
- **How a third-party plugin saves presets today** (FilamentHub, a community plugin described in the discussion):
  - It writes the preset `.json` and `.info` files directly under `data_dir`, finding the folder from `preset.file` rather than from the app config.
  - It then either does an experimental targeted refresh or asks the user to restart OrcaSlicer.
  - The host can't reload a single preset, and the plugin has to handle name collisions itself.
  - Community members have requested a preset write API, targeted refresh, and preset change events, but nothing has been committed.
- **Related issue:** [#14832](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/issues/14832) (closed) was a crash when transferring changed settings between printer presets while a Python plugin was loaded. It's worth retesting the comparer's save flow against that scenario.

All three were merged into OrcaSlicer `main` as of October 2026.

Directives:

- **Ship the plugin as a Pages capability.** A main-window tab is the most discoverable entry point, and its message calls run inside the audit scope, the same as a future, tighter sandbox would require. Add a script capability that opens it in a window only if a pop-out view turns out to be needed.
- **Build the UI as one self-contained HTML file** (Vite + `vite-plugin-singlefile`), so the plugin can return it from `get_ui()` (or pass it to `create_window`). Don't rely on loading extra assets at runtime.
- **Design the plugin's file I/O for the strictest sandbox.** Assume every read and write is checked, even the ones that currently aren't. Use the Python standard library only (no third-party packages). Import everything when the plugin loads, so lazy imports don't trip the keyword filter.
- **Keep comparer settings behind the `SettingsStore` port.** Store user preferences (such as default filters or recent comparisons) through it. The plugin adapter implements it with `get_config`/`save_config` and the desktop adapter with a local file. The UI never knows which.
- **Keep the Python layer thin.** It may only translate bridge messages into `orca.host` calls and file I/O, and back. No diffing, resolution, or business logic belongs in Python.
- **Keep every `orca.*` reference** in the Python files and every bridge detail in `host-orca`. A plugin API change should touch only those two.
- **Version the bridge protocol.** Define the message types once in `bridge-protocol`, include a protocol version in a handshake, and validate every message on both sides.
- **Style through design tokens.** The plugin build maps the UI's tokens onto `--orca-*` (see "UI/UX rules").
- **Keep to features all three OS web views support.** Set the build's browser targets to match WebView2, WebKit, and WebKitGTK, and test on all three.
- **Treat plugin saving as unresolved.** Without a preset write API, saving means writing files directly while OrcaSlicer holds presets in memory and may overwrite them or not reload them.
  - Report `canSave: false` from the plugin adapter until saving has been tested on all three OSes. Linux is blocked until the `conf` keyword problem above is fixed upstream (follow #15944).
  - When saving is enabled, model what the user must do after a save as part of the save result (for example `reloadRequired: "restart"`). The UI should tell the user what to do instead of assuming the change took effect.
  - Recheck discussion #14878 and the wiki for a write, reload, or change-event API before building this. If one appears, implement it only in the plugin adapter and the Python layer.
- **Expect file-access denials.** The audit hook can refuse a read or write, or prompt the user for permission. The plugin adapter must turn those refusals into typed errors in `core` (for example `AccessDenied` with the path), and the UI must explain them. Never let them surface as raw Python exceptions or crash the plugin.
- **Expect the plugin API to change.** It's new. Pin the OrcaSlicer version range the plugin is tested against, and detect missing APIs at startup instead of failing partway through.

## Open questions

- **Plugin packaging format.** The build currently produces one `.py` file, like OrcaSlicer's sample plugins. Issue #15944 mentions plugins packaged as wheels, which would allow shipping the page and an icon as separate files. Check the plugin wiki before changing `apps/orca-plugin/scripts/build-plugin.ts`.
